dotfiles
========

Requirements for setting up a machine for familiarity. Contains customizations for zsh and tmux. More to come.

Installation

For now, simply copy the files to home. Can update with a bash script later. See [here](https://github.com/mislav/dotfiles/blob/ea86d75e11e518ffe861f6d821b54e11804dfc17/install) for an example.


To Dos

[ ] Bash script
[ ] Research if iTerm customizations are required
